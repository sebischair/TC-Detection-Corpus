# TC-Detection-Corpus
This repository contains a corpus of links to Terms and Conditons (T&C) pages in German and English web shops which were used to train different classifiers for the automatic detection of T&C pages. In addition, it also contains links to the landing pages of the online shops and links to a random other pages, which is neither the langing page nor a T&C page.

If you use the data please cite our WEBIST 2020 paper:
